# üéµ Music Genre Classifier and Equalizer

## üìã Description

This project analyzes the audio being played on your computer, converts it into a MEL spectrogram, and uses a deep learning model to classify the music genre. Based on the detected genre, it sends a command to [JamesDSP](https://github.com/Audio4Linux/JDSP4Linux) to adjust the music equalization according to the genre-specific profile.

## üß© Features

- **Audio Capture**: Monitors and captures the audio being played on your computer.
- **MEL Spectrogram Conversion**: Converts the captured audio into a MEL spectrogram.
- **Music Genre Classification**: Utilizes a deep learning model to classify the genre of the audio.
- **Automatic Equalization Adjustment**: Sends commands to JamesDSP to adjust the equalization based on the detected music genre.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-genre-classifier.git
   cd music-genre-classifier
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

1. Start the main script to begin monitoring audio and adjusting equalization:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The system will capture the audio, generate the MEL spectrogram, classify the music genre, and adjust the equalization in real-time.
